# Burp Suite
## 1. Burp Suite Overview

- Industry-standard web application security testing framework
- Java-based, used for manual web, API, and mobile app pentesting
- Core capability: Intercept, inspect, and modify HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- Acts as a man-in-the-middle between browser and server
- Enables request/response manipulation before reaching destination

## 2. Burp Suite Editions
### Community Edition
- Free, non-commercial use
- Manual testing focused
- Limited automation and rate-limited tools
- Used for learning, labs, and manual assessments
### Professional Edition
- Automated vulnerability scanner
- Unrestricted Intruder (no rate limits)
- Project saving & report generation
- Burp Collaborator (out-of-band detection)
- Extension API + unrestricted BApp Store
- Preferred in professional pentesting
### Enterprise Edition
- Server-based continuous scanning
- Automated periodic scans
- No manual attack workflows
- Used by large organizations for monitoring

## 3. Core Tools (Community Edition)
### Proxy
- Intercepts and modifies HTTP/HTTPS requests & responses
- Central control point for all traffic
- Sends traffic to other tools (Repeater, Intruder, etc.)
- Logs traffic even when interception is off

### Repeater
- Manual request replay and modification
- Used for:
  - SQLi payload tuning
  - Auth bypass testing
  - Parameter manipulation-
- Essential for manual exploitation
Intruder
- Automated request spraying
- Use cases:
  - Brute force
  - Fuzzing parameters
- Community edition is rate-limited
### Decoder
- Encode/decode data (Base64, URL, Hex, etc.)
- Used for:
  - Cookie analysis
  - Token manipulation
  - Payload preparation
### Comparer
- Byte-level or word-level comparison
- Useful for:
  - Response diffing
  - Auth bypass detection
  - Logic flaw analysis
### Sequencer
- Analyzes randomness of tokens
- Common targets:
  - Session IDs
  - CSRF tokens
- Weak randomness → session hijacking risk
### Extensions
- Extend Burp functionality
- Supported languages:
  - Java
  - Python (Jython)
  - Ruby (JRuby)
- Installed via Extender / BApp Store
- Example: Logger++ for advanced logging

## 4. Installation
- Kali Linux: Pre-installed or install via apt
- Windows / Linux / macOS: Official installer from PortSwigger
- Linux non-sudo install:
  - Path: ~/BurpSuiteCommunity/
  - Not added to PATH
- Default installer options are usually sufficient

## 5. Dashboard
### Quadrants
1. Tasks
- Background processes (e.g., live passive crawl)
2. Event Log
- Proxy start/stop, connection details
3. Issue Activity (Professional only)
- Scanner findings
4. Advisory
- Vulnerability details & remediation
- Mostly inactive in Community
### Help Icons
- Context-specific documentation
- Useful during real assessments
## 6. Navigation
- Top Menu: Switch between modules
- Sub-Tabs: Module-specific configuration
- Detach Tabs: Window → Detach (multi-screen workflows)
### Key Shortcuts
- `Ctrl + Shift + D` → Dashboard
- `Ctrl + Shift + T` → Target
- `Ctrl + Shift + P` → Proxy
- `Ctrl + Shift + R` → Repeater
- `Ctrl + Shift + I` → Intruder
## 7. Settings
### User (Global) Settings
- Persistent across sessions
- Affects entire Burp installation
### Project Settings
- Session-specific
- Not saved in Community edition
### Settings Window
- Search-based navigation
- Filter by:
  - User settings
  - Project settings
  - Categories
- Tools link directly to relevant settings
### 8. Burp Proxy (Critical Tool)
- Intercepts client ↔ server traffic
- Actions on intercepted requests:
  - Forward
  - Drop
  - Edit
  - Send to other tools
- Intercept toggle:
  - On → manual control
  - Off → passive logging
### Logging
- HTTP history
- WebSocket history
### Advanced Features
- Response Interception (rule-based)
- Match & Replace
  - Regex-based request/response modification
  - Used for headers, cookies, user agents
## 9. Browser Proxy Configuration (FoxyProxy)
- Proxy address: 127.0.0.1
- Port: 8080
- Burp must be running
- Intercept ON → browser will hang until action taken
- Best practice:
  - Close unused tabs
  - Disable intercept when not needed
## 10. Target Tab
- Site Map
- Auto-generated by browsing
- Tree view of application structure
- Useful for:
  - Endpoint discovery
  - API enumeration
  - Manual crawling
## Issue Definitions
- Reference list of vulnerabilities
- Useful for:
  - Report writing
  - Vulnerability descriptions
### Scope
- Define in-scope / out-of-scope targets
- Prevents noise and accidental testing
### 11. Burp Suite Browser
- Built-in Chromium browser
- Pre-configured proxy
- No external setup required
### Linux Root Issue
- Sandbox failure when running as root
- Solutions:
  - Run Burp as non-root (recommended)
  - Disable sandbox (less secure)
## 12. Scoping & Targeting (Best Practice)
- Always define scope before testing
- Add target → Right-click → Add to Scope
- Stop logging out-of-scope traffic
- Proxy settings:
  - Intercept only in-scope URLs
- Results:
  - Cleaner traffic
  - Reduced mistakes
  - Professional workflow
## 13. HTTPS Proxying
### Problem
- Browser doesn’t trust Burp CA
- TLS errors on HTTPS sites
### Solution
- Download CA: http://burp/cert
- Import into browser certificate store
- Trust for website identification
- Enables full HTTPS interception
