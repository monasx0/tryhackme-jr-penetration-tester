# Pentesting Fundamentals

## Task 1 - What is Penetration Testing?
A penetration test, or **pentest**, is a simulated attack used to check the strength of a system's defenses. While hacking is usually seen as illegal, a pentest is a **controlled and approved** way to discover vulnerabilities. 

Professionals use the same tools and strategies as intruders to find weak spots before a real threat emerges. Since an online attack occurs every **39 seconds**, these tests serve as digital safety inspections to guard sensitive information.

## Task 2 - Ethics and the Rules of Engagement
Hacking only gains legal status if it is properly **sanctioned** by the system owner. Before any exercise, the tester and owner discuss the **scope**, which sets clear limits on what can be touched. Some organizations follow specific frameworks, such as the `CHECK` framework used in Britain.

### Hacker Categories
* **White Hat:** The "good guys." They work under strict rules to help companies and always follow legal paths.
* **Grey Hat:** These individuals might assist people, but they often ignore legal boundaries or moral standards to achieve their goals.
* **Black Hat:** Criminals on the wrong side of the law. They break into systems just to gain cash or destroy data.

### Rules of Engagement (ROE)
This document is created at the start of a project and consists of three main parts:
1. **Permission:** This provides the legal protection for the testers to carry out their work.
2. **Test Scope:** This defines the exact targets, such as specific `servers` or `IP addresses`.
3. **Rules:** This defines the allowed methods. For example, it might state that `phishing` is not permitted.

## Task 3 - Penetration Testing Methodologies
A **methodology** is a collection of set steps followed during a test. A typical path includes these key phases:

1. **Information Gathering:** Finding publicly available info about the company.
2. **Scanning:** Using tools to see which programs or services are active inside the system.
3. **Exploitation:** Using a discovered weak spot to slip through the defenses.
4. **Privilege Escalation:** Attempting to climb the "permission ladder" to gain `admin` or `root` rights.
5. **Post-Exploitation:** Checking connected systems and collecting details without being detected.



### Main Frameworks
* **OSSTMM:** Focuses on how devices like phones or wireless setups talk to each other.
* **OWASP:** The standard for checking if web applications are secure by design.
* **NIST:** Provides detailed guidelines for managing general cyber risks.
* **NCSC CAF:** A government-backed framework used for key systems like banks.

## Task 4 - Testing Scopes (The Boxes)
The amount of information a tester has determines the type of test being performed:

* **Black-Box Testing:** The tester knows nothing about the internal workings. They act like an ordinary user. This requires more effort and extra research time.
* **Grey-Box Testing:** The tester has partial insight or limited understanding. This approach is very popular because it saves time and effort.
* **White-Box Testing:** The tester has full visibility of the code and logic. Engineers often use this to make sure every piece of their program meets safety standards.

## Task 5 - Conclusion
By using these structured methodologies and staying within the **Rules of Engagement**, penetration testers provide a vital service. They find the "unlocked doors" in a system so they can be patched before a **Black Hat** hacker finds them.
