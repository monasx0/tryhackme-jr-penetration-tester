# Principles of Security
## Task 1 - Introduction to Information Security
This write-up outlines the principles of data security. The primary goal of **Information Security** is protecting data through a strategy called **Defence in Depth**. 

**Defence in Depth** means using multiple, different security layers to protect data. If one security layer fails, the other layers are there to protect the organization from harm.

## Task 2  The CIA Triad
The **CIA Triad** is a famous security model used to create rules that keep systems safe. It is a continuous cycle; if even one part of the triad is broken, the entire security system fails.

* **Confidentiality:** This is about keeping information private. We must ensure only authorized people can look at specific data. For example, only the **Human Resources** team should be able to see employee records.
* **Integrity:** This ensures that data is correct and has not been changed by mistake or by a hacker. We use tools like `Digital Signatures` or `Hashes` to prove that data is original and has not been altered.
* **Availability:** Data is only useful if authorized users can get to it when they need it. Companies aim for `99.99% uptime` to ensure their services are almost always available.

## Task 3 - Principles of Privileges
Access to systems is determined by a person's specific job role and how sensitive the data is. 

* **PIM (Privileged Identity Management):** This involves matching a person's job role to a specific role on the computer system.
* **PAM (Privileged Access Management):** This manages exactly what those roles are allowed to do. `PAM` keeps an eye on people with access to important data to ensure they only do what they are supposed to do.
* **The Principle of Least Privilege:** This is a vital rule. Users should only have the **minimum access** required to do their job and nothing more.

## Task 4 - Security Models
There are formal models used to reach the goals of the **CIA Triad**:

* **Bell-La Padula Model (Confidentiality):** This model focuses on keeping secrets. Its main rule is **"no write down, no read up."** This prevents people from reading secrets above their clearance level or sharing secrets with people at a lower level.
* **Biba Model (Integrity):** This is the opposite of Bell-La Padula. Its rule is **"no write up, no read down."** This stops users from changing information at a higher level than their own. It is commonly used in software development to keep code safe.

## Task 5 - Threat Modelling and Incident Response
**Threat Modelling** is the process of figuring out what can go wrong with a system. A common framework for this is `STRIDE`:

* **Spoofing:** Someone pretending to be someone else.
* **Tampering:** Changing data without permission.
* **Repudiation:** When someone denies they did something. We solve this by `logging` (keeping a record) to prove an action took place.
* **Information Disclosure:** Leaking private or sensitive information.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Breaking a system on purpose so nobody can use it.
* **Elevation of Privilege:** When a normal user gains `admin` or `root` rights.

### Incident Response
When a security break happens, it is called an **Incident**. A team called the `CSIRT` (Computer Security Incident Response Team) handles this through six steps: 
1. **Preparation**
2. **Identification**
3. **Containment**
4. **Eradication**
5. **Recovery**
6. **Lessons Learned**

## Task 6 - Conclusion
Information Security is not just about using one tool; it is about building a strong system with many layers. By using the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) and following the Principle of Least Privilege, organizations can create a solid foundation for safety.
