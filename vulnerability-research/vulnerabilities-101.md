# Vulnerabilities 101 

## Introduction

Understanding **vulnerabilities** is essential for **penetration testing**. This room covers what vulnerabilities are, why they matter, how they're rated, and where to research them.

**Learning Objectives:**
- What **vulnerabilities** are
- Why they're important
- How **vulnerabilities** are rated
- **Databases** for vulnerability research

## What are Vulnerabilities?

### Definition

A **vulnerability** is a flaw or weakness in a system or application that allows attackers to gain **unauthorized access** or perform **unauthorized actions**.

**NIST Definition**: "A weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source."

### Five Main Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Operating System** | Flaws in the OS (privilege escalation, kernel exploits) |
| **Configuration-Based** | Improper settings (default passwords, open ports) |
| **Weak Credentials** | Easy-to-guess passwords (admin:admin) |
| **Application Logic** | Flaws in how the app works (auth bypass) |
| **Human-Factor** | User mistakes (phishing, social engineering) |

## Vulnerability Scoring

### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

**CVSS** rates vulnerabilities using three criteria:
1. How easy to exploit?
2. Do exploits exist?
3. How does it affect **CIA triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)?

**Scoring Scale:**

| Rating | Score | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Low** | 0.1-3.9 | Minor impact |
| **Medium** | 4.0-6.9 | Moderate impact |
| **High** | 7.0-8.9 | Serious impact |
| **Critical** | 9.0-10.0 | Severe impact |

**Pros**: Free, widely adopted, consistent
**Cons**: Not context-aware, static scoring

### VPR (Vulnerability Priority Rating)

**VPR** is a **risk-driven** framework by Tenable that considers:
- Organizational relevance
- Current threat landscape
- Dynamic daily updates

**Pros**: Context-aware, dynamic, risk-focused
**Cons**: Proprietary, not free, less standardized

## Vulnerability Databases

### NVD (National Vulnerability Database)

Lists all **CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**.

**Format**: CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER (e.g., **CVE-2017-0144** - WannaCry)
**Website**: https://nvd.nist.gov/

### Exploit-DB

Database of **exploits** organized by application name, version, and author.
**Maintained by**: Offensive Security
**Website**: https://www.exploit-db.com/
