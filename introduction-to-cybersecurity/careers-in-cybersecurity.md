# Cyber Security Career Guide: Roles and Responsibilities

## Task 1 - Introduction
The cyber security industry is experiencing a massive surge in demand, with over **3.5 million unfilled positions** globally. Careers in this field are highly sought after due to:
* **High Starting Salaries:** Competitive pay even at entry-levela positions.
* **Dynamic Work Environment:** Tasks range from "legal hacking" (offensive) to high-stakes investigations (defensive).
* **Job Security:** A consistent need for professionals to protect digital assets against evolving threats.

## Task 2 - Security Analyst
Security Analysts are the "first responders" of the digital world. They focus on identifying vulnerabilities and monitoring networks to detect active threats.

* **Primary Goal:** Maintain the security of an organization's data.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
    * Analyzing cyber security posture across the company.
    * Compiling reports on network safety and incident responses.
    * Developing security plans based on new attack trends.
* **Learning Paths:** *Pre-Security*, *Cyber Security 101*, and *SOC Level 1*.

## Task 3 - Security Engineer
While Analysts monitor systems, Security Engineers **build** them. They design the architecture and implement the security controls that protect the organization.

* **Primary Goal:** Design and maintain security controls to prevent attacks.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
    * Testing and screening software security measures.
    * Monitoring networks to update and patch vulnerabilities.
    * Implementing hardware and software for optimal defense.
* **Learning Paths:** *SOC Level 1*, *Jr Penetration Tester*, and *Offensive Pentesting*.

## Task 4 - Incident Responder
Incident Responders work under pressure to mitigate attacks as they happen. They are measured by metrics like **MTTD** (Mean Time to Detect) and **MTTR** (Mean Time to Recover).

* **Primary Goal:** Identify and stop attackers while operations are unfolding.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
    * Creating actionable incident response plans and protocols.
    * Conducting real-time assessments during a breach.
    * Post-incident reporting to prevent future recurrences.

## Task 5 - Digital Forensics Examiner
If you enjoy detective work, this role involves collecting and analyzing digital evidence that is often used in legal proceedings.

* **Primary Goal:** Investigate incidents and crimes using digital forensics.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
    * Collecting evidence while strictly following legal procedures.
    * Analyzing data from devices to reconstruct events.
    * Exonerating the innocent or providing evidence against the guilty.

## Task 6 - Malware Analyst
Also known as **Reverse Engineers**, these professionals take malicious programs apart to see how they function.

* **Primary Goal:** Learn how malware works to develop better detection methods.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
    * **Static Analysis:** Reverse-engineering code without running it.
    * **Dynamic Analysis:** Observing malware in a safe, controlled "sandbox" environment.
    * Converting machine language back into readable code (often Assembly or C).



---

## Task 7 - Penetration Tester
Commonly called **Ethical Hackers**, Penetration Testers are authorized to break into systems to find flaws before real criminals do.

* **Primary Goal:** Test products for security loopholes through systematic hacking.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
    * Conducting security assessments on networks and web apps.
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities to evaluate actual risk.
    * Providing recommendations to fix discovered issues.
* **Learning Paths:** *Jr Penetration Tester* and *Offensive Pentesting*.

---

## Task 8 - Red Teamer
Red Teamers go a step beyond Penetration Testers. They emulate sophisticated adversaries to test how well the company's **defenders** (the Blue Team) can detect them.

* **Primary Goal:** Play the role of an adversary to test detection and response.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
    * Emulating real-world threat actors over long-term assessments (often up to a month).
    * Maintaining access and avoiding detection within the network.
    * Assessing the effectiveness of incident response procedures.
* **Learning Paths:** *Red Teamer* and *Offensive Pentesting*.
